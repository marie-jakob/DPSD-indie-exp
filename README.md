# DPSD-indie-exp

This project contains the implementation of a recognition memory experiment using Javascript and the JSPsych library that will be conducted as part of my Master's Thesis on the independence assumption of Yonelinas (1994) Dual Process Signal Detection Model. 

To run the experiment locally, open the respective index html file in a browser. Both versions ran via a JATOS server; the respective versions are stored in `JATOS-versions` (those will not work in the browser). To enable the dev-mode to skip to the end of experimental blocks using "q", set `DEV_MODE = true; in the respective index file.

### Procedural Details (short)

* __Learning Phase__ (tested three different manipulations)
* __*LOP manipulation *__: Participants are sequentially presented with words and are instructed to type either rate the pleasantness of that word on a 6-point scale or to count the number of vowels of the given word ("shallow" condition)
* __Test Phase__: All words from the learning phase + an equal amount of new words are presented. Participants have to make a Remember-Know-New judgement, followed by a familiarity rating on a pseduo-continuous scale



### Files

```index_LOP_pleasantness.html```: main file for the new LOP condition containing a pleasantness rating in the "high" condition

```index_LOP_pleasantness_lab.html```: main file for the new LOP condition for the laboratory

```.gitignore```: the usual

```LICENCE```: copyright information

```instructions.docx```: Instructions (not up to date, several changes were directly made in the implementation)


**Folders**

```experiment-files```:
* ```demographics.js```: Contains demographic questions
* ```dummy_stimuli.js```: Contains dummy stimuli in a format that can be read from the other .js files. Generated by stimuli_to_json.py
* ```functions.js```: Contains all functions used in the experiment and related files.
* ```global-variables.js```: Declares and sets all global variables that are used
* ```instructions.js```: Contains the instructions as JSPsych variables
* ```post-exp-questions.js```: Contains the post-experimental questions
* ```JATOS-versions```: zipped JATOS versions of the experiments.

```stimuli```: 
* ```description word list.docx```: Description of the stimuli
* ```dummy_stimuli.csv```: random strings serving as dummy stimuli until we've decided on the actual stimuli. Generated by the python script
* ```stimuli_to_json.py```: Reads the wordpool and writes the words to a .js file so that the stimuli can be used from the other .js files
also contains functions to generate dummy stimuli, save them, and put those into a .js file
* ```wordpool.xlsx```: contains the stimuli in excel format

```jspsych-6.3.0```: Latest version of the jspsych library. See https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych + some modified files (-custom).

# DPSD-indie-pilot

This project contains the implementation of a recognition memory experiment using Javascript and the JSPsych library.
The experiment will be the pilot study for my Master's Thesis on the independence assumption of Yonelinas (1994) 
Dual Process Signal Detection Theory Model.

### Procedural Details (short)

* _Learning Phase_: Participants are sequentially presented with words for a fixed duration and are instructed to remember them. 
* Some words are presented once ("weak items"), some three times ("strong items")
* _Test Phase_: All words from the learning phase + an equal amount of new words are presented. Participants have to make a Remember-Know-New judgement, 
followed by a familiarity rating on a pseduo-continuous scale


### WIP Stuff & TODOs

* Decide on the manipulation + change implementation accordingly
* instructions (wording + format)
* demographic questions
* post-experimental questions
* deployment via JATOS


### Files

```index.html```: main file -> open locally to test the experiment

```.gitignore```: the usual stuff

```LICENCE```: copyright information

**Folders**

```experiment-files```:
* ```blocks.js```: Contains all blocks with experimental and practice trials and the corresponding elements (e.g., fixation cross)
* ```dummy_stimuli.js```: Contains dummy stimuli in a format that can be read from the other .js files. Generated by stimuli_to_json.py
* ```functions.js```: Contains all functions used in the experiment and related files.
* ```instructions.js```: Contains the instructions as JSPsych variables
* ```setup.js```: Executes the basic setup steps for the experiment, such as generating the stimulus list, generating a participant ID etc.

```stimuli```: 
* ```dummy_stimuli.csv```: random strings serving as dummy stimuli until we've decided on the actual stimuli. Generated by the python script
* ```stimuli_to_json.py```: generates the dummy stimuli, saves these in a .csv. 
Uses this .csv (and later a csv containing the actual stimuli) to build a .js file so that the stimuli can be used from the other .js files
